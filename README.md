# hirarchical-human-action-recognition-based-human-robot-interaction
This repo will consist of three parts:
* Distance evaluation
* close pose estimation
* safe control limit

commitment log:
* run pipeline v0: can run pipeline, but no masked frame and blazepose might lose frames
* run pipeline v1: solve the problem of blazepose losing frames(actually it is still slow, but we won't see the lost frames any more)
